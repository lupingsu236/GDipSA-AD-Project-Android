# GDipSA Application Development(AD) Project - Android 
Android mobile application (MRT4You) prototype developed by my team for NUS-ISS GDipSA course's Application Development (AD) Project. The AD Project consists of a .NET application to be used by MRT train operators (see https://github.com/lupingsu236/GDipSA-AD-Project-.NET) and this Android mobile application for public users. 

## Project Specifications / Requirements 
For the Application Development(AD) project, teams were to build an integrated solution consisting of a web application and mobile application based on a chosen problem statement. 
Our team's proposed MRT Journey Planner Application (titled MRT4You) aims to tackle the problem of inconvenience caused by train disruptions to Singapore residents by sending real-time alerts. 
The proposed application allows train operator staff to log train disruptions via the web application, and such information will be pushed as notifications to public users of the mobile application. 
The MRT shortest route algorithm on the mobile app also considers the real-time situation, such as any breakdown or delay.

The main features for the web app include: 
1. View current status of rail line / stations 
2. Update status of train stations 
3. Analyse history of train disruptions 

The main features for the mobile app include: 
1. Search for shortest route 
2. Save frequent routes
3. Receive real-time notifications and updates on train disruptions
4. View most updated rail system map 

## My Contributions to the Project
My main contributions for the mobile app include: 
1. 'View system map' use case 
2. 'Search for shortest route' use case, excluding basic implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm
3. 'Manage saved routes' use case 
4. 'View status of lines' use case
5. Overall layout and UI of mobile app 
6. Overall integration, testing and debugging
